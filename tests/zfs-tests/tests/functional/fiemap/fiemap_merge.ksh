# DESCRIPTION:
#	Blocks that sit next to each other on a vdev merge into one
#	extent, including on raidz and when compressed, where a block
#	allocates more than its physical size.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. On a raidz1 pool write 1 MiB of random 128k records, and
#	   1 MiB of compressible ones to an lz4 dataset.
#	2. From zdb's DVAs, count the runs of blocks where each block
#	   starts on the same vdev where the one before it ends.
#	3. FIEMAP maps exactly that many extents, and sets
#	   NOT_ALIGNED from the offsets and lengths it reports, not
#	   the allocated size.  If no two blocks landed next to each
#	   other, nothing was tested.
#
