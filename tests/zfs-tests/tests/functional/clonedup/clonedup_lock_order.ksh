# DESCRIPTION:
#	A block clone between two files never deadlocks with an apply
#	batch that is redirecting blocks of both.  The batch takes the
#	destination range locks in apply order and keeps them until it
#	commits.  A clone takes its two range locks in znode address
#	order.  Two runs queue the files' blocks in opposite orders,
#	and the files stay open so their znodes keep their addresses,
#	so one of the runs takes the locks against the clone's order.
#	Each run starts the clone once the first block is locked and
#	the batch is waiting before the second.  The run and the clone
#	must both finish.
