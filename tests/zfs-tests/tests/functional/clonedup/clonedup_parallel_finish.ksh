#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	With several apply workers, a run is not finished until every
#	worker has committed the clones it queued.  Two workers share
#	three candidates in one mounted dataset, so one of them runs
#	out of work while the other still holds the last candidate.
#	When "zpool clonedup -w" returns, every block must already be
#	shared and the run's record must count every clone the kstat
#	counted.
