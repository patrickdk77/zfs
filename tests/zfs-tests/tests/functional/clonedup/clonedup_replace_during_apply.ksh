# DESCRIPTION:
#	A run torn down while its apply workers hold candidates leaves
#	the next run alone.  A full run that replaces a default one,
#	and a default run started right after a cancel, both finish,
#	keep their counters in range, and report as applied exactly
#	the clones the kstat counted.
