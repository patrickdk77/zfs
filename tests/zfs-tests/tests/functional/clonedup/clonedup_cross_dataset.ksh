# DESCRIPTION:
#	Cross-dataset pairs obey zfs_bclone_strict_properties: a
#	differing copies= property is refused with the tunable set and
#	cloned without it.
#
#	The apply always refuses a pair whose block pointers hold
#	different DVA counts, since the clone installs the source
#	pointer whole.  The test writes both files at copies=2 and
#	lowers one dataset's property afterwards, so only the
#	property comparison can refuse the pair.
