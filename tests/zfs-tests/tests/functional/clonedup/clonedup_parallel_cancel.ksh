# DESCRIPTION:
#	A run with several apply workers can be stopped while every
#	worker is inside the apply, the pool exported and imported,
#	and a later run finishes the work.  Each step must return
#	within a bound: a worker that never leaves its loop keeps the
#	apply thread waiting for it, and an export waits for the
#	apply thread.
