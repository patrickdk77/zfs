#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	A run restarted by an import keeps the txg bound it started
#	with.  The partitions finished before the export were walked
#	up to that bound, so the blocks born after it belong to the
#	next run.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Cap the index so the run takes several partitions, and slow
#	   the apply so the run outlasts the steps below.
#	2. Start a run and wait for its second partition.
#	3. Write a file and a copy of it, then export and import.
#	4. Let the run finish.  Its bound and its last txg must be the
#	   bound it started with, not the import txg.
#	5. The next run must share every block of the copy.
