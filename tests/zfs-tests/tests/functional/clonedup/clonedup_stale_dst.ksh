# DESCRIPTION:
#	A destination block that changed between the index walk and
#	the apply is skipped as stale, not cloned over.  The apply
#	re-reads every destination inside its transaction and
#	compares the block pointer against the one the walk recorded,
#	so a block rewritten and synced in between no longer matches
#	and must be left alone.
