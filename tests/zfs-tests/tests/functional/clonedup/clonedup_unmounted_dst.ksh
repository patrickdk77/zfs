#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	Files in an unmounted filesystem and blocks of a closed volume
#	are rewritten by owning the dataset.  The content is unchanged
#	once the filesystem is mounted and the volume opened again.
#	The test needs cp to clone a into keep, so that the only
#	file on a mounted filesystem already shares the source.
#	Where cp copies instead, the test is skipped.
