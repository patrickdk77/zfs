# DESCRIPTION:
#	clonedup=source lets a dataset's blocks be shared by others
#	but never rewrites them; clonedup=off excludes a dataset
#	entirely, is inherited, and can be set back to on under an
#	excluded parent.

# An excluded parent must not exclude a child that sets the property

# child has to be reached as a dataset of its own and not through the
# parent it hangs under.  The last check is the converse: the parent
# is still excluded after a run that cloned inside its child.
