#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	A default run after a finished one matches its new blocks
#	against older data.  The counting pre-pass counts only the
#	new blocks, so that run never takes it, even with the
#	pre-pass forced on.  A quick run pairs new blocks among
#	themselves and still takes it.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Finish a first run with the pre-pass off, so the pool has
#	   a last_clonedup_txg.
#	2. Copy an old file.  Each new block then has exactly one
#	   duplicate, and that duplicate is older than the window.
#	3. Force the pre-pass on and make a default run.
#	4. The copy shares every block with the original, and the
#	   run took no pre-pass and dropped nothing.
#	5. Write a new pair and a unique file and make a quick run.
#	   It takes the pre-pass, drops the unique blocks and still
#	   clones the pair.
