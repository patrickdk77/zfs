#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	Which copy becomes the source does not change the result, so
#	the choice does not have to consult the BRT to make it.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Build a group where one copy is already block cloned and
#	   the rest are not, so the copies differ in BRT state and in
#	   nothing else.
#	2. Run, and every copy shares one block with identical
#	   content.
#	3. Build the same group with the already-cloned copy written
#	   last, reversing which copy the BRT holds, and require the
#	   same outcome.
#
#	Source ranking reads the DCE_F_MAYBE_SHARED flag the index
#	stored and does not look the block up in the BRT.  A wrong
#	guess costs one BRT entry and must never change the outcome.
