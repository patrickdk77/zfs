#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	zpool scrub -p pauses scrubs only.  With a clonedup run in
#	progress and no scrub, it has nothing to pause and leaves the
#	run going, the way it does on a pool with no scan at all.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Hold a clonedup run in its first walk.
#	2. zpool scrub -p exits 0 and the run is neither paused nor
#	   gone.
#	3. zpool clonedup -p pauses it, and a plain zpool clonedup
#	   resumes it to the end.
