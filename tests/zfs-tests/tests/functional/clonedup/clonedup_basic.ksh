#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	Two identical files end up sharing every block after a run.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Write a file and copy it byte for byte.
#	2. Run zpool clonedup and wait for it.
#	3. Every block is shared, the counters agree, content is
#	   intact, last_clonedup_txg advanced, and zdb finds no leak.
