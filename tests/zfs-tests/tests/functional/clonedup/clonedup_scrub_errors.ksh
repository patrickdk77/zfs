#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	A scrub reports its own errors and none of an earlier
#	clonedup run's.  The clonedup error count belongs to the
#	clonedup status.  Once a scrub is the scan on record, zpool
#	status and zpool status -j show only what the scrub found.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Fail every read of one copy so a clonedup run counts
#	   verify errors, then clear the injection.
#	2. Check that the run reported its errors.
#	3. Scrub the pool, which reads back clean.
#	4. The scrub line and the JSON scan stats show no errors.
