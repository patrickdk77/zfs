#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	Without the clonedup feature a run cannot start and nothing is
#	written to the pool.  A dry run writes nothing either way, so
#	it runs without the feature.  Enabling it later lets a real
#	run start.  Without block_cloning both are refused, and
#	enabling clonedup does not enable block_cloning.
