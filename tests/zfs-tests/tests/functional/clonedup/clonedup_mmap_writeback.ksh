# DESCRIPTION:
#	A store through a shared mapping, into a block the apply has
#	already locked, neither hangs the apply nor gets lost.  One
#	batch redirects blocks 0 and 1 of one file, and both blocks
#	have pages in the page cache.  The test dirties block 0
#	through the mapping after the batch locks it and before the
#	batch reaches block 1.  Writing that page back needs the range
#	lock of block 0.  The run must finish, and once the page cache
#	is dropped the file must hold the store.
#

# ms the apply waits before each block; the store lands in the wait
