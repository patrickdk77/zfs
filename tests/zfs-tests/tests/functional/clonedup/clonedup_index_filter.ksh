#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	The counting pre-pass changes what the index costs, not what
#	the run does.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Run with the filter forced off and record what was cloned.
#	2. Rebuild the same pool and run with it forced on.
#	3. The same blocks are shared either way, and the filter
#	   reports having dropped blocks that could not pair.
